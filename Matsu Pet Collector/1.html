Okay, so I need someone to indulge me in a few of my rarer kinks. These kinks are bitchsuits, cock milking, and mummification. If you could indulge me in at least one of those kinks as a Matsu in a noncon RP, I&#39;d love that a lot!

I have a few ideas for scenarios and pairings as well. They are:

1. Oso/Choro: Oso gets fed up with Choro acting all high and mighty, so he ties him up, gags him, and humiliates him.

2. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and taken to a cock milking farm.

3. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and put into a petplay slave training program (bitchsuits required)

4. Totty/OCs: Todomatsu gets invited to a mixer by a cute girl, but soon discovers it&#39;s a trap when he&#39;s trussed up, gagged, and taken to a strange place.

5. Any/OC - That&#39;s Gakuen Musical AU - Matsu gets kidnapped by bullies and humiliated

6. Any/Akumatsu - Akumatsu materializes in a new body and has his way with one of his &#34;brothers&#34;

7. Oso/OC - Oso gets caught cheating at a casino and gets interrogated. After admitting to it, he basically becomes the casino&#39;s whore for paying customers.

If you have any other ideas, feel free to share!

My kinks include heavy bondage, shibari, struggling/thrashing, gags (!!!), bitchsuits (!!), suspension bondage, nipple clamps, begging, toys, double/triple penetration, humiliation, degradation, crying, recording, blindfolds, latex, public use, spanking, mummification bondage, orgasm denial, fucking machines, overstimulation, drool/saliva, electricity, cock milking, breathplay, and likely more! Hard no&#39;s are are anything unsanitary, gore, vore, pregnancy, bestiality, or death.

I await your connection!</p>

So how would this start out? Would we start it out with the boys already having been kidnapped and being taken to their new master&#39;s home?</p>

            <p>I think that’ll work just fine! 

And if you don’t mind my asking, would you be okay with the boys not being able to talk all at once? Probably gagged for the most part and only one or two able to talk so I don’t get overwhelmed by sheer numbers?</p>

            <p>(( right! some animal ideas I have are horse, dog, rabbit, pig, bird, snake, and maybe sloth. 

the bird could be suspended in the air for most of the day and toyed with. the sloth could be completely locked in place and barely able to move an inch. the snake could be mummified and forced to scoot along the floor if he wants to move. and the pig could wear a nose hook to resemble a pig&#39;s nose, and wear a curly tail butt plug in his ass.

if you have ideas, I&#39;d love to hear them!</p>

            <p>Ooh!

Okay so with the bird I love the suspension idea. And maybe it’s a little on the nose but maybe their suit just completely restricts their arms behind their back like wings (maybe complete with flaring sleeves so they looked like wings) but then there were specialized mechanics coming from the legs to make the talons so whoever it is could still clumsily grab at things like how a bird would but they’re like...forced into a squat so they’re hobbling? If not that’s cool but their suit should definitely be very colorful and maybe their gag turns all their moans and protests into trills a bird would make.

The sloth is really interesting to me since it’s like having an exotic pet. Maybe there’s an electric current running through the suit that keeps them locked up and throughout the day it fluctuates so when they’re squirming they can move just a little before the suit paralyzes them again.

Snake is good too. Especially if he has a big tank with heat lamps that would make him sweat it out.

I don’t know about the pig but I think the nose hook could also work with the rabbit and they have a fluffy tail plug.</p>

            <p>(( I really like your ideas! I love the idea of the bird having their arms behind their back and the suit being really colorful.

And oooh, the electric current that forces the sloth to stay still could be really interesting!

And I love that snake idea with him trapped in a tank. And the rabbit with the nose hook could also work! The fluffy tail idea is adorable too.</p>

oso - sloth

choro - bird
ichi - cat
jyushi - dog
todo - rabbit
