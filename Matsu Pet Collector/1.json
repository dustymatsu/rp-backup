These kinks are bitchsuits, cock milking, and mummification. If you could indulge me in at least one of those kinks as a Matsu in a noncon RP, I'd love that a lot!\r\n\r\nI have a few ideas for scenarios and pairings as well. They are:\r\n\r\n1. Oso/Choro: Oso gets fed up with Choro acting all high and mighty, so he ties him up, gags him, and humiliates him.\r\n\r\n2. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and taken to a cock milking farm.\r\n\r\n3. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and put into a petplay slave training program (bitchsuits required)\r\n\r\n4. Totty/OCs: Todomatsu gets invited to a mixer by a cute girl, but soon discovers it's a trap when he's trussed up, gagged, and taken to a strange place.\r\n\r\n5. Any/OC - That's Gakuen Musical AU - Matsu gets kidnapped by bullies and humiliated\r\n\r\n6. Any/Akumatsu - Akumatsu materializes in a new body and has his way with one of his \"brothers\"\r\n\r\n7. Oso/OC - Oso gets caught cheating at a casino and gets interrogated. After admitting to it, he basically becomes the casino's whore for paying customers.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other ideas, feel free to share!\r\n\r\nMy kinks include heavy bondage, shibari, struggling/thrashing, gags (!!!), bitchsuits (!!), suspension bondage, nipple clamps, begging, toys, double/triple penetration, humiliation, degradation, crying, recording, blindfolds, latex, public use, spanking, mummification bondage, orgasm denial, fucking machines, overstimulation, drool/saliva, electricity, cock milking, breathplay, and likely more! Hard no's are are anything unsanitary, gore, vore, pregnancy, bestiality, or death.\r\n\r\nI await your connection!"}, {"symbol": 1, "symbol_character": "\ud83c\udf00", "handle": "\ud83c\udf00", "colour": "000000", "show_edited": false, "id": 47435687, "type": "ooc", "edited": "2018-01-06T05:26:30.291424", "format": null, "posted": "2018-01-06T05:26:30.291424", "text": "Okay, you and I totally share an abundance of kinks with one another and I\u2019d absolutely love to piece something together with you because I hardly ever find anyone else who\u2019s interested in bitchsuits and mummification."}, {"symbol": 0, "symbol_character": "\u25cf", "handle": "\u25cf", "colour": "000000", "show_edited": false, "id": 47438617, "type": "ooc", "edited": "2018-01-06T07:39:16.124462", "format": null, "posted": "2018-01-06T07:39:16.124462", "text": "(( hi!
