            <p>Hey!
Figure I should just sort of pitch my OC and whatnot.
His name’s Raymond Torres, but he more commonly goes by Ray. Works at the police station as their medical examiner, but literally no one likes him because he’s extremely abrasive and people just think that there’s something off about him. He’s tall and lanky with curly black hair and green eyes.

And because the world itself is magical it’s pretty similar to the cultist thing like I said before but we can also include more monsterous aspects to things too.</p>

            <p>(( sounds interesting, both your OC and the world it takes place in!

monster stuff sounds fun as well, I&#39;d love that</p>

            <p>(( it&#39;s totally fine! I&#39;ll do my best to give this one a lot of attention along with our Matsu RPs.

Any particular way you want things to unfold for Ray?</p>

            <p>I figure we just treat it similarly to the Matsus honestly? 
Probably taken by criminals since he works for the police and maybe they can’t have him figuring stuff out. But we could twist it up by they don’t just outright kidnap him and take off. We could add some hypnosis and Ray goes to work to help them out with whatever when they need and then he comes back for his new life as their toy.</p>

            <p>They could even just keep him as a pet in his own apartment and whoever it is just moves in and takes over.</p>

I can start us off and everything unless you have any cool new ideas to throw out there bondage wise? I mean I’ll still start us off then too.</p>

            <p>I like the sound of that!

Oh just an appearance tidbit since we are including the fantasy pieces. Ray is human but he has a bit of monster blood in him - which doesn’t really show except for in his eyes where his pupils are split into four. It’s kind of the other reason people don’t like or trust him since he looks completely human otherwise.</p>

            <p>Ray shifts his jacket over his arm as he digs through the pocket for his key ring, wanting nothing more than to duck inside his apartment and start his weekend of relaxation. Unless a major case popped up, he wouldn’t have to come in to work until Monday. And even then he was already planning on coming in late - everyone was well aware that he did what he wanted and was prone to disappear for short periods of time. It wasn’t like he could be fired when their was no one else for the job.

Crossing the threshold, his eyes narrow - split pupils hovering over the dark apartment as he lingered in the doorway. The ward protecting his apartment was down, which meant it was either on the fritz or he’d had an unwelcome visitor earlier in the day. Nothing looked disturbed otherwise though and Ray shrugged off the paranoia as he set his things over the chair.</p>
