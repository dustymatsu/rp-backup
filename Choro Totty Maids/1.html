            <p>(( anything else we should talk about? certain scenarios and such? maybe Totty could have some kind of gag in his mouth with a duster sticking out for when he&#39;s cleaning the place up</p>

            <p>Definitely because I didn’t think much further than the cock ring and handcuffs scenario. But the duster is brilliant! Maybe something in his ass that goes deeper when he has to bend down to use it?</p>

            <p>Definitely! 

Oh the maid outfit itself could be latex and make it harder for him to move around, changing into a corset and stopping at his nipples so they can still be played with.</p>

            <p>(( of course! Maybe have him wear an armbinder so he can&#39;t use his arms to clean, he can only use the duster attached to the gag</p>

            <p>Which would also thrust out his chest more. And hey! If we did want to include Choro then he could be put in a very similar situation but he’s just treated as a doll</p>

            <p>(( nice idea! while Totty cleans, Choro is heavily bound in another latex maid outfit and is only around to be toyed with, stored away when he&#39;s not in use</p>

            <p>Right! 

I think his dress would actually be more “extravagant” and he could have his hands cuffed in the way I initially said if we’re putting Totty in an arm binder</p>

            <p>Shin and Daichi always had trouble keeping their place clean. Most of it was from laziness, as they&#39;d rather spend time hosting parties and such.

So when Daichi brought up the idea of finding a maid, Shin couldn&#39;t get the idea out of his mind. The two didn&#39;t plan ahead very much, but decided to kidnap the first cute guy they saw walking alone at night.

Not only did they find a cute guy, but a cute pair of twins. They acted accordingly, running out of their car to snatch the two. Tying them up with rope and gagging them with a cloth, they shoved them into the trunk before driving off.

When they got back to their house, they retrieved the new maids from the trunk, carrying them through the door and shoving them onto the couch.

&#34;Good thing we bought two outfits, huh?&#34; Shin says as he smirks down at them, grabbing onto two latex maid outfits from the nearby table.</p>

            <p>Choro and Totty had been enjoying a perfectly ordinary day before they’d been kidnapped - planning to stop at the grocery store at some point before making their way back home where the rest of their brothers were lounging around. 

Matsus weren’t the type to be kidnapped and gagged, spilled out onto their captor’s couch and leered down at like they are now. 

Muffled protests make their way through each gag at the statement, two sets of eyes also landing on the latex outfits.</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Daichi and Shin ignore their protests as they snip away the captives&#39; clothes, handling them rather roughly as they pinch and pull at their nipples.

Daichi holds onto Choro as the more extravagant maid outfit is forced on him, lots of frills and ribbons attached to the latex. The outfit&#39;s top ends at the nipples, almost like a corset.

&#34;You don&#39;t really strike me as the maid type...&#34; Shin says, looking up his skirt to poke at his cock. &#34;So I think we&#39;ll just use you as a sex doll.&#34;</p>
