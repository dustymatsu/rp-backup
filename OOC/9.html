            <p>That’s what I was thinking. And yeah the scanning tech would be pretty cool! 

And I think the 69 would be fantastic!</p>

            <p>(( perfect! who do you think should be the mobile one? Maybe Oso since he&#39;d be destroyed seeing his brothers permanently encased?

should he also be kidnapped first or should someone else be?</p>

            <p>(( I was also thinking that the immobile matsus could be given medicine through a tube connecting to their mouths or asses or elsewhere (depending on their cast position) that gives them nutrients, basically pseudo-science so they don&#39;t die and have to keep living in their permanent states</p>

            <p>Oh that’s a really good idea! So we have Oso as the Cast Dalmatian 
Two Matus in a 69 with one another
Maybe another one is in the kitchen and Oso has to use his mouth as a food bowl and his cock as a water bowl?</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>(( oh that&#39;s great! would something be stuffed in the kitchen Matsu&#39;s mouth for Oso to eat? Or would he just be forced to kiss him?</p>

            <p>I think it would be stuffed in to make a wider dish and if it was a funnel and wet food then the dish Matsu would also be able to get his food from there</p>

            <p>(( sounds good!

still trying to think of a function for the last Matsus... I was thinking one could be stuck in a wall with his ass and mouth available for use by his owner and whatever guests he invites. I was also thinking that one could be trapped in a mummy coffin and put on display as an art piece, forced to be pleasured by whatever toys are attached to him but unable to cum.</p>

            <p>I like the wall idea. What if the last Matsu was in a cast and rubber to protect it and he was used as bath toy rubber duck?</p>

            <p>(( oh yeah, definitely!

so if oso is the dog, we should assign the other matsus to their roles. I was thinking Kara could be the rubber duck, choro could be the food and water bowls, Ichi and Totty could be the 69, and Jyushi is stuck in the wall.</p>
