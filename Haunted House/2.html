            <p>(( yeah! maybe they kind of &#34;train&#34; him to fit the role of a mermaid by seeing how long he can hold his breath, along with some sort of potion that gives him those features as they train him more and more</p>

            <p>Then they can have him out of water and watch him drag himself around with his arms since he wouldn’t have legs anymore. And if we added a second Matsu, Jyushi is a werewolf so they could give him a collar and a dog house.</p>

            <p>(( oh, good ideas! totty would be pretty helpless without legs, and Jyushi would make a good werewolf! maybe they train him to be obedient like a dog?</p>

            <p>One of the Matsus finally gets a job as a secretary and that goes about as well as one could expect when the actual position is boss’s new sex toy. I was thinking a little set up on a rolling platform that they can push themselves around on but their hands are cuffed to where they can’t be fully extended and they’re collared and ring gagged for maximum use. Still capable of running office errands</p>

            <p>Not exactly? I’ve just been working with a lot of dollies recently so I’ve been surrounded by moving platforms. Basically just a platform the Matsu could sit on with four beams on the corners with horizontal supports that would trap him inside. Hands cuffed to the vertical beams and an x-shape at the top that would form into the circle collar</p>

            <p>(( I had an idea as well for a potential RP. Basically a Matsu is in The woods or a fantasy world of some kind and gets kidnapped and toyed with by a clan of spider/human hybrids. Wrapped up in silk cocoons and forced to satisfy the clan in any way they desire.

Either that or we could expand on that where he gets toyed with by different types of monsters, like they make a pact with each other to lend him out for a week at a time</p>
