Rather like his namesake, Ichimatsu is lithe and made up of lean muscles that aid in his abilities to twist and stretch like an ordinary house cat. 

&#34;You really think you&#39;re going to get away with this?&#34; He asks with a scoff. &#34;You won&#39;t be so confident when you&#39;re in prison.&#34;">

        <p>Ichimatsu&#39;s eyes narrow at the patronizing statement. It wouldn&#39;t have been the first time that his costume hit damaged on the job, but it&#39;d never been reduced to nothingness before either. Swallowing his nervousness, the hero steels himself.</p>
