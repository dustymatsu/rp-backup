            <p>I put a little more thought into it and maybe he goes to America on a student visa. Then whoever he meets steals his visa and passport and goes through with the kinky sham of a marriage for a green card that way in order to keep Totty for himself. And maybe the guy lives on some kind of farm and whenever he isn’t treating Totty like a housewife he treats him like livestock.</p>

            <p>Definitely! And then in the actual house it’s like a corset and high heels and other stuff as his role as “wife”. Gags with cleaning tools attached so he can do chores</p>

            <p>(( absolutely! when it&#39;s time to go to sleep, Totty doesn&#39;t even have the privilege of being in a warm bed, unless he&#39;s being used as a sex toy. He could either sleep in the stable or be stationed as furniture - bound in tight bondage with a toy inside him</p>

            <p>Thomas took his fantasies a little too seriously in many cases. For one, he had a large collection of kinky porn on his computer. Second, he currently had a bound and gagged Japanese man in the back of his car, whom he was going to &#34;marry&#34; and make his.

He first came across Totty at a coffee shop while looking for a cute guy that would fit his role of a proper plaything. It didn&#39;t take him long to decide that he was the one, soon drugging him and knocking him out before forcing him into a wedding dress. After tying him up and gagging him, Thomas found his passport and visa and kept it, deciding that he would no longer need it.

The ceremony was minutes away, excitement building as Thomas wondered when his &#34;wife&#34; was going to wake up.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">
            2018-07-08 04:13:55

        </li>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Now, actually.

Totty comes to slowly, eyes opening just barely and squinting at the sun coming through the window that his face is currently pressed up against. Groaning, he tries to piece together a hazy memory of the last few days. 

He’d come to America on a student visa...met a guy in a coffee shop a couple of time who seemed really friendly. It was a little hard to tell when his English wasn’t that great, but Thomas had smiled a lot and Totty had taken it to mean a good thing. Especially when he offered to go up to the counter and order for Totty - who’d been having trouble ordering the correct drinks for a few days now. And...that’s the last thing he remembers. He doesn’t even know whose car he’s in, not until he sees Thomas looking at him through the rear view mirror.

Feeling the need to ask the American what had happened, Totty first realizes that he’s been gagged. A plain white ball gag, holding in some kind of cloth to prevent even the loudest of whimpers to escape. What was going on? Panicking slightly, Totty also takes in the very thick veil obscuring his vision and looks down to find that he’s been changed into a wedding dress.

Not only that but he’s been expertly bound underneath the dress in some kind of shibari that’s forcing his arms behind his back.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">
            2018-07-08 04:35:25
          </div>
        </li>
        <li id="message_50850582" class="message_ic" style="color: #000000;">
            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>&#34;Good, you&#39;re finally awake,&#34; Thomas smiles at Totty as he comes to, taking in the sight of his new wife as he&#39;s overcome with panic.

&#34;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re confused, huh?&#34; He chuckles, stopping at a red light as he begins his explanation. &#34;I&#39;ll be straight with you - you&#39;re never going back to Japan.&#34;

The light turns green, prompting Thomas to drive forward.

&#34;I&#39;ve been looking for a cute little thing like you for a long time now. And now that I&#39;ve got you, I can&#39;t let you run off. You see, Todomatsu, we&#39;re going to be getting married today.&#34;

Thomas takes a right turn, the building where the ceremony is taking place coming into view.

&#34;And once you&#39;re my wife, you&#39;ll live to please me, and only me. But don&#39;t worry, as long as you listen to everything I say, I won&#39;t punish you.&#34;

Thomas finally stops in front of the building, exiting the vehicle and opening the door to pick up Totty bridal-style as he carries him to the door.</p>
