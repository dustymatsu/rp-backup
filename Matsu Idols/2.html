            <p>(( oh yes! the girls are gagged so they can&#39;t protest what&#39;s being done to them, maybe even hooded to show off some of that scanning technology</p>

            <p>Mmhm! They’re probably always gagged so that they can’t explain what’s happening to them. Meanwhile the manager assures the public that the Matsus decided themselves to take the group in this direction.</p>

            <p>(( some of the variety shows have the potential to be really fun as well. maybe they&#39;re on a game show at one point where they have to complete humiliating tasks while heavily bound and gagged. the losers of the match are punished</p>

            <p>Oh definitely! But I think we can start with them already in the stocking and tape bondage, probably all forced onto display stands with dildos in both holes. Being streamed live as they go into their first training session</p>

            <p>Awesome! Oh another thought was that whenever they aren’t doing publicity things or concerts then the manager probably keeps them as his personal toys.</p>

            <p>Idols had taken Japan by storm in the past, but not many had gotten legions of fans quite like the Matsuno sisters had. All identical in looks, but very different in personality, the sisters were quickly rising to stardom, having released several popular albums and singles.

Everything seemed to be going well for the sextuplets, but with a recent change of manager, things had gotten quite awful for them.

Kenji Yamada was a man of obscene tastes, as the girls quickly found out once he introduced the &#34;new direction&#34; their group would be heading in. Instead of singing and dancing, they would be forced to endure intense bondage, forced into a hiatus specifically for training. The girls weren&#39;t given much of a choice when Kenji&#39;s bodyguards trussed them up in tape and stockings, also shoving the latter in their mouth before using thin strips of tape to keep it in.

Now forced onto display stands with dildos in each of their holes, the Matsus are helpless to stop the cameras from rolling as Kenji starts to livestream their first training session. His bodyguards begin to place the masks over their heads as Kenji points the cameras at them, an erection already growing in his pants at their bound forms.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <p>Life came easy for the Matsuno sisters. Even with six distinct personalities that could have otherwise spelled disaster for another group, they managed to amass a large following of devoted fans who found it difficult to pick a favorite. Their albums and singles were popular enough to land them large venues - and they were always keen to show their gratitude with the fans that made everything possible, never forgetting to mention that their hard work would mean nothing unless their manager wasn’t so dedicated to their success.

The sisters had made certain to thank her publicly when the agency made the change to Kenji, asking the man to guide their careers in the right direction. They’d regret that later...

Oso glances around the room as best she can with such restricted mobility, catching sight of her sisters in identical positions that she figures she must be in as well. In any other situation, she’d find it funny - the way that whatever material seems to be covering them distorts their various expressions. Like her, the rest of the Matsus are conscious and discovering their strange predicament. 

They can’t even protest as the masks are placed over their heads, tight and form fitting and made all the more uncomfortable by the layers of stocking already encasing them.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <p>Kenji focuses the cameras over their bound bodies, paying special attention to the newly-applied masks covering their faces. The masks weren&#39;t just masks, however - they could also scan the wearers&#39; faces and display them on a connected screen. Despite being hooded, the Matsus&#39; distorted, humiliating faces are still shown on the livestream for others to laugh at.

Kenji&#39;s bodyguards press a few buttons on their stands, the dildos thrusting inside the idols&#39; holes at an alternating pace. And all the while, more and more viewers are pouring in to watch the spectacle.</p>
