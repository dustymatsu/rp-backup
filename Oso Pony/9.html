            <p>&#34;Become a cat for you...what does that even mean?&#34; It&#39;s rather clear by the way he drawls out the question, he doesn&#39;t much care for the answer and is merely patronizing Shin for asking a question that doesn&#39;t even make sense.

They&#39;d been kidnapped by a couple of freaks, that much was certain.

Typically, Choromatsu would&#39;ve leapt on an opportunity to witness his brother&#39;s humiliation. He was the only one that actually seemed to care that they weren&#39;t doing anything with their lives and yet everyone always followed Oso&#39;s lead instead of his.

&#34;I&#39;d prefer if you let us all go,&#34; he states firmly, averting his eyes from the tank.</p>

            <p>Daichi&#39;s gaze follows Choro&#39;s eyes as they glance away from the tank, his hand reaching up to stroke his face.

&#34;Eh, really?&#34; He tilts his head, thumb resting on the NEET&#39;s bottom lip. &#34;I don&#39;t think so, Choro-kun. Your brothers are really fun to play with, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be, too.&#34;

His other hand drifts down to his hoodie, grabbing and prodding at his stomach from underneath the fabric.

Shin laughs at Ichi&#39;s question, motioning to Karamatsu&#39;s mummified form.

&#34;I mean a /pet/, Ichi-kun. Oso-kun and Kara-kun are both pets, so I think you&#39;d make a perfect kitten.&#34;

Flipping Kara over on his back, he strokes his cock gently, rubbing the tip with his thumb.</p>
