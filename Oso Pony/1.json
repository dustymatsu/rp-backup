You will be playing the Matsu(s), while I'll be playing their captor(s).\r\n\r\n1. Osomatsu gets told by a stranger at a horse race that he lost a bet to that there's a secret to always winning at the horse races, but he has to sign a contract to learn in. Oso accepts without reading it, but soon finds out that may have not been the best choice. The secret to always winning at horse races? Become the horse! Oso becomes a slave to a group of strangers and is forced to race against other slaves, all while in pony bondage gear. Lots of \"training\" would be very fun!\r\n \r\n2. One or more of the brothers gets kidnapped by a group of men and is forced to be publically used and humiliated.\r\n \r\n3. One or more of the brothers gets kidnapped and kept as a group of men (or women's) personal sex slave(s).\r\n \r\n4. Choromatsu goes to a Nyaa-chan concert and gets jumped in the bathroom, forced to be used publically by a bunch of horny fanboys who want to humiliate other fans to prove they love Nyaa-chan more.\r\n\r\n5. A monster girl kidnaps one or more of the Matsus and keeps them as her pet(s). Would /love/ tentacle or slime stuff.\r\n\r\nMore ideas will likely be added! My kinks include heavy bondage, shibari, struggling/thrashing, gags (!!!), bitchsuits (!!), suspension bondage, nipple clamps, begging, toys, double/triple penetration, humiliation, degradation, crying, recording, blindfolds, latex, public use, spanking, mummification bondage, orgasm denial, fucking machines, overstimulation, drool/saliva, forced exercise (like being forced to walk on a treadmill), and maybe more! Hard no's are anything unsanitary, gore, vore, pregnancy, bestiality, or death.
