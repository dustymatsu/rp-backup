            <p>(( what would you feel about, after a few weeks or so of oso being their pet, one of the other matsus gets kidnapped and shares his brother&#39;s enslavement? and if you&#39;re ok with it, they could be forced to do things with each other or else get severely punished</p>

            <p>Hey! Momentarily back and I&#39;m doing better. I&#39;m completely down for that idea and I&#39;d love to see the drawing when it&#39;s done</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no where to go. He can&#39;t run. He can&#39;t hide. Fighting back would only get him punished or put him in an even worse situation. Though there isn&#39;t much to looking on the bright side either in Oso&#39;s opinion. 

He resists momentarily, unable to squirm his head away from the bottle pressed to his lips with the hand firmly against the back of his head. Eventually Oso concedes defeat, figuring it would just be easier to drink. 

Grimacing and nearly gagging at the taste, his throat pulses with every swallow as he chugs down his own seed. The thick fluid trickles down his throat and coats his tongue, and Oso whines as he finishes off the container over the course of several minutes.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <p>Shin doesn&#39;t let up for a second as he forces Oso to drink his own cum, reveling in his distressed noises. When he&#39;s finished off the bottle, he pulls it back, looking down into the slave&#39;s eyes.

&#34;You seem to have gotten at least a little used to crawling in that position...&#34; He says, giving his nipple another rough pinch. &#34;But you&#39;ll have to go faster if you want to succeed at those races in a few days.&#34;

Daichi grabs onto the leash, tugging it as he walks towards the door.

&#34;We&#39;ll get you set up for a training program we came up with,&#34; Daichi explains, yanking on the leash as he walks into the hallway. &#34;We have a treadmill for you to walk on to increase your speed, and a &#39;special diet&#39; for you to be on.

&#34;We even got you a cage for you to sleep in. Aren&#39;t we great masters, Oso-kun?&#34;

Shin grabs onto the mask and gag, following Daichi out the door.</p>

            <span class="symbol">üåÄ</span>
            <p>Having his chest, ass, and cock bared is easily going to be the peak of his torment in Oso&#39;s opinion. It&#39;s better without the mask because at least then he&#39;s able to see where things are headed - though it doesn&#39;t lessen the sting of pinch one bit. 

Sore cock throbbing between his legs, the smaller man crawls with the same humiliating wiggling along the floor that he&#39;s found easiest to make. It&#39;s a small victory that he&#39;s just barely fast enough to avoid being chocked. 

Hearing the plan laid out for him, Oso lapses into a terrified silence, eyes firmly rooted to putting one elbow in front of the other.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">‚óè</span>
            <p>The three reach Osomatsu&#39;s new room, for the most part looking the same as the other room except for the treadmill laid out and the large cage with a tube of semen attached to the side.

&#34;Here&#39;s where you&#39;ll be staying.&#34; Daichi walks towards the treadmill, tugging Oso along before Shin picks him up and places him on it. &#34;You&#39;ll be expected to stay in good shape, so we&#39;ll put you on the treadmill for at least 30 minutes a day. If you can&#39;t keep up, you&#39;ll be punished accordingly. Any comments before Shin puts the gag back in?&#34;

Shin holds the gag up to Oso&#39;s lips, wondering if he&#39;ll keep quiet or lash out.</p>

            <p>Oh! What do you think of when the other brothers are involved we create a sort of menagerie? With Oso being the horse of the group, I don&#39;t think it isn&#39;t entirely plausible for the other Matsus to be turned into other kinds of pets</p>

            <p>Obviously Ichi is a cat. From there we can probably just work with the typical barnyard cast. Dog, cow, pig, so on and so forth</p>

            <p>Each one then could have its own areas of kinks to focus on.

Oso is the racehorse so he&#39;s worked and exercised to the bone for competitions to be faster. 

Ichi could just be toyed around with for the most part and left alone to his own devices. Maybe drugged to replicate cat nip and whatnot.

The dog&#39;s trained to be obedient and watches/herds the rest of the pets when need be. Probably &#34;gets fixed&#34; and humps things, plays fetch, and bothers Ichi.

The cow&#39;s milked from his cock and maybe even given hormones to actually produce milk. Lots of nipple play there. 

And the pig&#39;s just used as an overall cum dump for everyone.

Which I&#39;m pretty sure just leaves one more brother if you have any animal ideas? Each suit could reflect it as well</p>

            <p>(( hmm, maybe a rabbit? or even a snake, where the brother taking that role is bound in a mummified or otherwise tightly constricted position! can&#39;t move his arms, maybe put a toy in him while all he can do is wiggle and squirm around</p>

            <p>Oooh I think a snake would be perfect! With all the brothers bound in different ways it&#39;d be great to see them all together. The snake could even have a rattler as he squirms.</p>

            <p>Right?

They can teach the dog all sorts of tricks too. I had an idea for the suit too. Paws could be attached but they&#39;re too big and heavy like a puppy so whichever brother we decide is just sort of bowling all over the place and the mask could even have big floppy ears attached that they step on and trip over or it activates an electrical shock of some kind</p>

            <p>Yes! And the snake could be secluded to a giant tank and put under heat lamps that would make the latex casing miserable.

They&#39;re also all essentially animals that could be put into shows to show how obedient they are.</p>

            <p>(( mmm~ I really like the idea of a matsu in a tank and under intense heat... whining and wiggling and panting through the holes in his mask~

and ooh yes I love the idea of them being put in shows! with the losers being punished to motivate them to win!</p>

            <p>We should probably assign the rest of the brothers to an animal so we&#39;re prepared. And are you cool with the cow actually growing tits and lactating due to hormones?</p>

            <p>(( I&#39;m not super big on lactation, so is it ok if we just milk his cock? unless you really want to do it of course.

as for the animals...

oso - horse
kara - snake
choro - pig
ichi - cat
jyushi - dog
totty - cow

do those work?</p>

            <p>Man, same here. Jyushi&#39;s suit should also be the only one that doesn&#39;t allow access to his cock so he&#39;s effectively neutered alongside the cock ring, but he&#39;s always stimulated to keep him horny</p>
