So I had an RP partner that disappeared that I miss greatly. I hope they come back at some point, but until then I&#39;ll keep posting prompts in hopes that others are also interested.

This is a Matsu noncon prompt, with a big emphasis on heavy bondage. I will be playing their captor(s), while you&#39;ll be playing at least one Matsu. I usually don&#39;t have a big preference for who you play, but at this moment I&#39;m craving a Karamatsu.

Some of my favorite kinks are mummification, bitchsuits, blindfolds, gags, fear, suspension, nipple clamps, and tons more I don&#39;t feel like listing. Feel free to connect if interested!</p>

            <p>So I was thinking something along the lines of a road trip? Maybe one of the Matsus has decided to get some traveling in and picks up the wrong hitch hiker (or hitches a ride in the wrong car). Either way lots of impromptu bondage and car sex.</p>

            <p>(( those are great ideas! does the driver have a specific location in mind or is he on a road trip? He could take him into hotels for the night and have him tied heavily while he gropes and sleeps with him, And when the long trip is over, he can take the Matsu to his home, where he&#39;ll stay permanently.</p>

            <p>Japan had many beautiful landmarks that were perfect for a road trip. But the main motivator for Shin to travel wasn&#39;t because of the beauty of the country, but because he was looking for something very specific.

Shin was depraved in many ways, especially when it came down to his sexual fantasies. His dream for the road trip was to kidnap an unsuspecting man and keep him all for himself for the duration of the trip. Shin packed several gags and toys, keeping them hidden in the car.

After a few days on the road, he spotted the perfect victim. A plain, somewhat scruffy looking hitchhiker was waiting for a ride on the side of the road. With nobody else around, Shin figured the timing was perfect.

He slowed down and stopped, exiting the vehicle to approach the hitchhiker. Hidden in his pocket were a pair of handcuffs and a thick cloth.

&#34;Need any help, sir?&#34; Shin asked with a smile.</p>

            <p>In comparison to the other five Matsunos, Ichimatsu considered himself to be the more adventurous. Maybe not in the sense of meeting new people, but he was more than content in areas that people were less likely to frequent - quiet places that he could blend into nearly as well as he did at home. Every other year or so he’d taken to small trips away from the city, finding off the beaten path sort of places that he alone could enjoy.

The only problem he faced each year was finding a way home. Ichi had never gotten around to procuring his own liscence and even then he didn’t have a car or the money to rent one. When he left town he usually hitched a ride with their next door neighbors before striking out on his own on foot. Getting home usually meant hitchhiking with someone kind enough to stop by the side of the road.

So he’s less than suspicious of Shin when the man gets out of his car and starts to approach. His own travels have him looking a little worse for wear, but he’s known for years that neither he or his brothers have a particularly threatening air about themselves. Every Matsuno was about as harmless as a fly. 

“If you’d be kind enough to give me a lift, I’d really appreciate it,” Ichi responds in turn, bowing his head politely. “You don’t have to take me very far. I can always find another ride later. I’m not in much of a rush.”</p>
          <div class="timestamp">
            2018-09-30 05:56:38

        </li>
        <li id="message_52313452" class="message_ic" style="color: #000000;">
            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Shin gives Ichi a small nod as he scans him up and down. Up close, he looks a lot cuter, his ruffled hair giving off a relaxed aura. He&#39;s not dressed in many layers, so stripping him down wouldn&#39;t be a problem.

And with no one around for miles, the kidnapping would take no time at all.

&#34;Of course,&#34; Shin obliges with a bigger smile. &#34;Since you aren&#39;t in too big of a rush, I hope you don&#39;t mind if I take a quick detour. There&#39;s some attractions I&#39;ve been wanting to check out...&#34;

He closes the distance between them, one hand resting on Ichi&#39;s shoulder. His other hand has grabbed onto the handcuffs in his pocket, slowly pulling them out as his grip tightens.

&#34;And one of those is standing right in front of me.&#34;</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>More than used to the ins and outs of hitchhiking by this point, Ichimatsu has learned to pick and choose who he goes with based on instinct. Most people were completely upfront with their intentions and it didn’t make choosing hard when Ichi could tell who was suspicious and who wasn’t. 

The bad feeling in the back of his mind doesn’t send him the alarm until Shin is already in his personal space and Ichi doesn’t have much of a choice in the matter aside from taking the diplomatic route.

“Oh...uhh..thanks?” To his credit, his voice doesn’t waver or betray his quickening heartbeat. His relaxed exterior was a tough one to crack no matter what happened to him. “But I just remembered that there’s a shrine in the area that I forgot to visit. I’m really sorry to have bothered you but I won’t be needing a ride until much later.”</p>
