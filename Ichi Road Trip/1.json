Every other year or so he\u2019d taken to small trips away from the city, finding off the beaten path sort of places that he alone could enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe only problem he faced each year was finding a way home. Ichi had never gotten around to procuring his own liscence and even then he didn\u2019t have a car or the money to rent one. When he left town he usually hitched a ride with their next door neighbors before striking out on his own on foot. Getting home usually meant hitchhiking with someone kind enough to stop by the side of the road.\r\n\r\nSo he\u2019s less than suspicious of Shin when the man gets out of his car and starts to approach.
