            <p>Yeah. I feel like it could verge into the ghost putting Kara into these predicaments with the invisible bondage and then he could be used by the public occasionally or just further humiliated.</p>

            <p>Kara has to be losing his mind. He didn’t think that he was, but it was a feeling a got every time he turned a corner or lingered in one place too long. Like he was being watched. Only no one was there that he could blame for staring at him. And the feeling followed him wherever he went lately, like whatever or whoever it was was waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. He all but convinced himself that it was just the workings of an overactive imagination - there was never any proof that he was being followed.

Washing his hands in the bathroom of the bar he’d hunkered down in, Kara whistled to himself cheerfully. 

The night was actually going rather well. He’d earned the ire of some of the other men in the bar, but he’d become extremely popular with the female customers in a short amount of time. If his luck continued, he might get a couple numbers or could even end up going home with someone.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Kara was definitely not imagining things. As far fetched as it was, someone, or rather, /something/ had been watching him for a week, waiting for a moment when the man would be at his most vulnerable.

And now seemed like the perfect time, with him in public with angry men in his general area.

The ghost acted quickly, using its powers to shove Kara down on his knees after he washed his hands. His clean hands were then shoved behind his back, locked in place. Finally, a force held his mouth open, acting as a gag and imvitation for anyone who wanted to use him.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">
            2019-03-27 07:21:53

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>“What the-!” 

It all happens too fast for Kara to completely understand what happened. And even if it happened slowly it’d be hard to figure out what could possibly happen to put him in his current position.

Did he slip and fall? It seems the most likely until he tries to get up - a difficult feat with his hands behind him and he can’t seem to use them. He can sort of get off his knees but whatever is keeping his hands behind his back seems to be attached to the sink’s piping. If Kara raises himself too high he risks hitting his head on the underside of the sink.

He tries calling for help but all that comes out is a gargled plea through his open mouth. He starts wiggling a bit in panic, drool coming out of his mouth and soaking the front of his shirt.</p>

            <p>It doesn&#39;t take long for other men to hear the pleading in the bathroom, curious as to what the noise could be. Awaiting them is a slobbering Karamatsu, on his knees and in a vulnerable position.

&#34;Well, would you look at this,&#34; one of the men chuckles as he approaches him. &#34;This little shit was trying to steal away a girl I had my eyes on... why don&#39;t you say we teach him a lesson?&#34;

The men agree, circling around Kara and unzipping their pants. Many line up in front of his mouth, stroking themselves off while waiting for their turn. The man in front eagerly yanks Kara&#39;s hair back before shoving his dick down his throat, another man behind Kara feeling him up under his shirt and groping his chest.</p>

            <p>“Nwaaah,” he whines, brows furrowing in disappointment as he recognizes the group he’d pissed off not even ten minutes ago. Why couldn’t he get back to his feet or close his mouth?

Kara shifts his head slightly, following the men as they move to surround him and subsequently block the only exit to the bathroom - completely useless given his invisible bindings. 

He winces when his hair is pulled and squints his eyes shut in pain when the dick is shoved into his mouth and nearly chokes him when he slides all the way down. His body is shaking a little underneath the hands on his chest, parts of his shirt still damp with drool and his leather jacket pulled taut around his arms.</p>

            <p>The men snicker as Kara shakes and quivers under the ministrations, the one in charge giving his nipples a quick pinch. Minutes later, the man thrusting down his throat cums, forcing him to choke it down.

&#34;That&#39;s what you get for trying to steal my property,&#34; the man says as he pulls back, slapping Kara across the face.

The next man in line takes out his phone, recording Kara as he forces himself into his mouth. More nipple pinches are administered, the men laughing as the phone records the man pulling out at the last second and coating his face in cum.

&#34;Tongue out, you damn bastard,&#34; he commands as he aims at his face.</p>

            <p>Kara gags on the taste of the man’s cum. Poor girl, he thinks, a look of disgust passing over his features as he swallows before it’s replaced with a painful one when his nipples are pinched. It’s hard to keep track of what man is doing what when all Kara wants to do is escape the bathroom.

He blanches when the man smacks him across the face with enough force that he’s fairly certain he’ll end up with a minor bruise in the morning. 

And he really tries not to focus on the fact that he’s being recorded, flinching whenever his nipples are pinched and proving just how sensitive they are. Wanting to get the ordeal over with, he sticks out his tongue when he’s ordered to.</p>
