I want to play as a monster girl/boy who kidnaps a Matsu and makes him their pet. Stuffs him with tentacles, shares him with other monsters, all that good stuff. Any Matsu is good with me! I just want to see them stuffed in every hole, wrapped up in silk bondage, molested by goo, or whatever we come up with!\r\n\r\n2. I want to play as a group of faceless men or women who kidnap a Matsu (or more) and makes them into tickle slaves. Running feathers along his body, hooking him up to a machine that tickles him everywhere, making him so sensitive to light touches that even the briefest contact makes him squirm... that'd be fun.\r\n\r\nI have a ton of kinks, so I'll just list my hard no's: unsanitary stuff, vomit, bestiality, gore, vore, mpreg, and death.
