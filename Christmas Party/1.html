Hey, it&#39;s the person who&#39;s been posting all those ososan noncon prompts, and I&#39;m back again with a masterpost of ideas that I&#39;ve had! You will be playing the Matsu(s), while I&#39;ll be playing their captor(s).

1. Osomatsu gets told by a stranger at a horse race that he lost a bet to that there&#39;s a secret to always winning at the horse races, but he has to sign a contract to learn in. Oso accepts without reading it, but soon finds out that may have not been the best choice. The secret to always winning at horse races? Become the horse! Oso becomes a slave to a group of strangers and is forced to race against other slaves, all while in pony bondage gear. Lots of &#34;training&#34; would be very fun!
 
2. One or more of the brothers gets kidnapped by a group of men and is forced to be publically used and humiliated.
 
3. One or more of the brothers gets kidnapped and kept as a group of men (or women&#39;s) personal sex slave(s).
 
4. Choromatsu goes to a Nyaa-chan concert and gets jumped in the bathroom, forced to be used publically by a bunch of horny fanboys who want to humiliate other fans to prove they love Nyaa-chan more.

5. A monster girl kidnaps one or more of the Matsus and keeps them as her pet(s). Would /love/ tentacle or slime stuff.

More ideas will likely be added! My kinks include heavy bondage, shibari, struggling/thrashing, gags (!!!), bitchsuits (!!), suspension bondage, nipple clamps, begging, toys, double/triple penetration, humiliation, degradation, crying, recording, blindfolds, latex, public use, spanking, mummification bondage, orgasm denial, fucking machines, overstimulation, drool/saliva, forced exercise (like being forced to walk on a treadmill), and maybe more! Hard no&#39;s are anything unsanitary, gore, vore, pregnancy, bestiality, or death. If you would rather not include a specific kink or have other ideas, let me know!</p>

            <p>Whenever Boss saw something or someone he wanted, he always made sure he got it. Being a ringleader for a criminal group, he was highly respected by his partners and his will was always carried out.

His latest victims were the Matsuno sextuplets: six virgin NEETs who would likely not cause any stir if they disappeared. He sent out his best workers to track them down and kidnap them, and if a recent message was to be believed, they had succeeded and were on their way to the base.

Sure enough, a knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Straightening his tie, Boss walked up to the door and opened it. Six of his bodyguards had a Matsuno brother slung over their shoulder, each brother bound and gagged with tape. 

Boss ushered them inside, where the brothers were dumped on the floor in front of his desk. Osomatsu, the eldest, had his gag ripped off as he was forced to face towards the ringleader.

&#34;Osomatsu Matsuno,&#34; Boss said, sitting down at the desk. &#34;You&#39;re the eldest brother, correct?&#34;</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

        <li id="message_47003290" class="message_ic" style="color: #000000;">
            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Oso yelps as the tape is ripped from his mouth, grimacing and struggling against the rest of the tape binding him. The air is filled with the muffled grunts and protests of his still gagged brothers who writhe against their bonds. 

With a worried expression, he nods hesitantly. “I’m the oldest, yes.”

Had they forgotten to pay their rent? Not as far as he knew - and even then he’d never seen these men before in his life and he was willing to bet that his brothers hadn’t either.</p>

        <li id="message_47009773" class="message_ic" style="color: #000000;">
            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Boss chuckles darkly, pleased with Osomatsu&#39;s worried expression and the muffled protests from his gagged brothers.

&#34;I see.&#34; He stands up from his seat, walking towards the eldest brother with a smirk. His hand reaches out to grip onto his chin, forcing his head up towards him.

&#34;Well, Osomatsu, since you&#39;re the oldest, perhaps you&#39;d like the first demonstration on what I&#39;m about to do to your brothers?&#34;

Boss leans in, lips barely brushing against the smaller man&#39;s before diving into a kiss. Both hands grip onto his hair, locking him in place while he forcibly kisses him, pulling away to look into his eyes.

&#34;Well, that&#39;s part of it, at least,&#34; he chuckles.</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Oso’s expression twists into one of confusion with the kiss, eyes wide open with shock. If that was only part of what was going to be done with them, he hates to think of what the entirety of the plan is.

But bound as they are, it would be damn near impossible to even attempt to escape - something that had a low chance of succeeding even if they were free to move of their own accord. Oso flinches with the prolonged contact on his head and pulling at his hair painfully.

“We won’t tell anyone about this if you just let us go,” he tries to bargain.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Boss shakes his head at Osomatsu&#39;s offer as he gives him a few rough pats to the cheek, thumb running over his bottom lip.

&#34;I don&#39;t think so, Oso-kun,&#34; he says, nodding to the bodyguards as they take a few steps closer to the pile of struggling sextuplets. Rough hands grope under their hoodies, playing harshly with their flesh as they pinch and pull at their nipples.

&#34;Just listen to me and this won&#39;t have to be so difficult.&#34;</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Several of the sextuplets begin to yelp and whine through their tape gags, having ceased their squirming up until their nipples start to be tugged at. Oso can only watch helplessly before looking back to Boss and ducking his head submissively. 

There was definitely a part of him that had tricked himself into thinking that playing along might just get them released without too much trouble.</p>
