            <p>It’s gonna be pretty great!

Should we plan the different layers?</p>

            <p>(( sure!

for the first layer, a straitjacket and a vibrator in his ass would be nice. on the second layer, kara could have his ankles bound with cuffs and his boxers in his mouth. third layer, he&#39;s mummified in tape. fourth layer, he&#39;s wrapped in a plastic wrap. fifth layer, more tape, and the earbuds followed by a mask.

by the sixth layer, he&#39;s placed inside a tight rubber sleeve. the seventh and final layer has him taped up once more, and a cock ring as punishment for not escaping.

the hypnosis could also make his body more sensitive to the vibrations, among other things</p>

            <p>I like it! The straight jacket crosses his arms but there’s also the part that hitches through the legs and that would keep the vibrator in. 

The hypnosis makes him more sensitive to the vibrations and makes him want to serve the magician as his assistant.

This could all take place in one show and once he’s properly conditioned they go on tour and perform in other venues. Plus sex pet on the tour bus.</p>

            <p>(( I love that idea! maybe at some rare opportunities he snaps out of it and tries to escape, only to be severely punished and reconditioned into being an obedient pet once again</p>

            <p>(( thanks!

punishments could range from public humiliation to other forms of torture, such as being heavily bound and stored away in a sleep sack while the hypnosis tape is playing, or making him wear slutty and humiliating outfits while locked in chasity and hypnotized into being constantly horny</p>

            <p>Kensuke was a man all about show business, and he&#39;d take whatever it took to get to the top, no matter what the cost.

For a while, business had been booming for him, but he still wasn&#39;t satisfied. He needed a new gimmick, something not seen very often in the magician industry.

His next show was all about that gimmick, which would involve an unlucky random member from the audience in an escape situation. But there would be no chance of escape, not with more layers being added until the assistant was practically a mummy. Afterwards, he&#39;d keep the assistant for himself.

Now, the time has come. Kensuke walks on the stage to an audience of a few thousand people, waving and smiling as the cheer.

&#34;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,&#34; he announces. &#34;Tonight is a very special show for all of you. And not just because the pamphlets said this was for mature audiences only.&#34;

Kensuke scans the audience, eyes landing on a young man near the back with a leather jacket.

&#34;For my first trick, I&#39;m going to choose a random member from the audience. And I think I know who... you, with the sunglasses. Step on up!&#34;</p>

            <p>Karamatsu wasn’t a fan of magicians by any means. The only reason he’s gone to this show was because Oso won a ticket from a radio contest and decided that he didn’t want to go as soon as the cab arrived. It’d be a waste if no one got to go - and Kara had been the only one to see the impracticality of not going when there was a taxi waiting for /someone/ to get inside. Idiots. 

At least knowing that the rating was for mature audiences meant he wouldn’t have to deal with groups of screaming children that thought everything they saw was real. Again, idiots.

He’d sit in the back, see what made the show “mature”, and most likely leave before the magician’s act was finished.

Because he didn’t account for being chosen as a volunteer.

Gritting his teeth and smiling good naturedly, Kara stalks up to the stage - shedding his leather jacket and handing it over to a stage hand when prompted before making his way to Kensuke’s side.</p>

            <p>Kensuke looks over Karamatsu as he stands next to him. He didn&#39;t have any particularly remarkable features, but he was cute in his own way. And he&#39;d look even cuter bound up on stage.

&#34;Welcome, welcome,&#34; he greets, smiling and placing a firm hand on his shoulder. &#34;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re surprised, huh? It&#39;s not everyday you get picked as a volunteer for a magic show.

&#34;Now, you know this is a show for mature audiences. So you might be uncomfortable at first. But if it&#39;s any consolation, I&#39;ll pay you once this is all over.&#34;

Kensuke fails to mention that the &#34;payment&#34; won&#39;t be in money.

&#34;So, I hope this doesn&#39;t sound weird, but I&#39;m gonna need you to take off your clothes.&#34;</p>
