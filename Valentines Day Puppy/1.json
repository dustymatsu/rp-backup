What the Hell had happened to him? Totty strains to think and fill in the gaps in his memory. \r\n\r\nHe remembered it being the day before Valentine\u2019s Day and hitting up the bars in search of some company...nothing off about that. Then someone had approached him and said he was an absolute gift and Totty preened at the compliment, choosing to stick around and try his luck. Now he just felt...stuck. \r\n\r\nAnd on the outside it\u2019s easy to see why. Red gift wrap with white hearts enveloped a long box that contained Totty, taped heavily shut and made to seem like an overly large chest for odds and ends. A particular observant person would notice the false bottom - underneath which held Totty in even more obscure layers. \r\n\r\nTotty tries to scream when he finds that he can\u2019t move, but the sound is stopped completely by a massive dildo cinched tightly so that the tip touched the back of his throat and caused him to gag. Unbeknownst to him that the final layer was a bubblegum pink bitchsuit and the dildo gag actually formed a dog about with the part not shoved down his throat. A similar tail plug was lodged into his ass and while he couldn\u2019t tell it yet, there was an extremely tight cock ring contracted around his member."}, {"symbol": 1, "symbol_character": "\ud83c\udf00", "handle": "\ud83c\udf00", "colour": "000000", "show_edited": false, "id": 54544817, "type": "ic", "edited": "2019-02-06T07:01:26.144565", "format": "raw", "posted": "2019-02-06T07:01:26.144565", "text": "Rika had told her boyfriend Seiji time and time again what she wanted for Valentine's Day.

So when she received a text from him to open her front door, she expected to find him standing there, a necklace in one hand and a puppy in another.\r\n\r\nInstead, she found a large box. Heavily taped shut, Rika was confused. Was this a prank of some sort? Seiji occasionally pulled them, but surely he wouldn't joke about a gift on Valentine's Day, right?\r\n\r\nDeciding to take a chance, Rika dragged the box inside, surprised at how heavy it was. With enough effort, she managed to bring it inside far enough. Now came the hardest part - tearing the tape off. Thankfully, she had a pair of scissors nearby, which she used to snip open the insane amount of layers. After several minutes of cutting tape, she opened it.\r\n\r\nSnug inside the box was an oddly shaped gift. Rika smiled at the hearts on the wrapping paper as she tore it off. Her smile soon faltered, however, when she found what she could only assume to be a footrest.\r\n\r\nThis was the best Seiji could do? Whatever. In any case, she might as well use it.
