            <p>Osomatsu bit the inside of his cheek as he walked the streets. He was about to make a big change in his life - something he’d been avoiding for a long time now but couldn’t afford to ignore any longer if he wanted the rest of his brothers to continue to live happily.

He needed a job. Thing was, almost any job available required training in skills that he just didn’t have. The sad side effect of living for so long as a NEET. 

Thankfully, he’d found a flyer for a company that seemed to be just for this kind of problem. A NEET correctional facility that would train him and get him on the right path to be a functional member of society. He’d be able to get a job and start helping out more around the house. He’d also left the flyer on the table at home in case any of his younger siblings wanted to make the change as well.

Pushing the doors to the facility open as he arrives, Oso tries his best to look presentable - a calm and confident stride and a cheerful smile as he approaches the secretary at the front desk.

“Excuse me, I’m here to check in.” He announces, bowing slightly. “Osomatsu Matsuno, I’m supposed to be learning how to make chairs?”</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>At first glance, the NEET Correctional Facility seemed like a nice agency. With NEETs being at the bottom of the social and economic ladder, many held disdain for them, so a facility to help them get higher in the work force would be valuable.

However, the facility wasn&#39;t what it seemed to be. When a NEET signed up for the service, they would not receive any help for the real world. Instead, the facility was a furniture company that specialized in using humans for their furniture. If a NEET went missing, nobody would notice, so it seemed like a perfect coverup.

The secretary smiles sweetly at Oso, stepping out from behind the desk and motioning towards a door.

&#34;Of course, right this way,&#34; she says, leading him into a small, dimly-lit room. Waiting for Oso is a chair, a big roll of duct tape, a large cloth, and a pair of scissors.

&#34;Feel free to make yourself comfortable...&#34; the secretary says, her voice growing seductive. &#34;Won&#39;t you be a good boy and sit down in the chair? I&#39;ll explain the next few steps after you do.&#34;</p>

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Alright, first step, not so hard. Oso feels a rush of relief. Really the hardest thing so far was making the decision to try and better his life in the first place. Making chairs didn’t seem that bad either - it’d likely be difficult but seeing something that he’d made by himself would probably give him a sense of satisfaction.

He’s a little confused by the sparse contents of the room but he figures that it must be part of the initial training and initiation. 

“O-oh sure!” Oso’s face flushed with the secratary’s tone, perfectly happy to do anything she said.

The eldest Matsu takes a seat in the comfortable reclining chair, resting his arms on the armrests and sitting up straight.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>The secretary smiles as Oso obeys her. Her seductive tone always seemed to work on NEET men, especially since a majority of them were virgins.

&#34;Good boy,&#34; she coos as she strokes his face. &#34;Hold still for me, okay? I promise that this part is really important.&#34;

Grabbing for the duct tape, she wraps Oso&#39;s arms to the armrests with a significant amount of tape. She gives his fingers gentle kisses before wrapping them up as well, eventually taping his hands into thick mitts.

&#34;I forgot to mention this, but this chair making thing isn&#39;t what you think it is.&#34; Her tone becomes darker as she gives him a cruel smile, reaching for the large cloth. &#34;Instead of building a chair, you /are/ the chair. You&#39;ll be wrapped up like this for the rest of your life, as a living piece of furniture. Isn&#39;t that great? A shitty NEET like you has a purpose now.

&#34;Now open up, cutie,&#34; she says as she moves the cloth closer to his mouth. &#34;Be a good boy for me and accept the gag.&#34;</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>He can’t help but lean into the touch. She probably saw dozens of NEETs trying to get their life on track so he has no idea whether or not he’s being given special treatment. He’d like to think so. Especially if he had the chance to ask her out once he went through his training and had a job.

“Whatever you say Miss,” he sighs, halfway in thought before the sound of duct tape ripping cues him in that something strange is happening. Was this normal for the facility?

Oso watches in confusion as his arms are taped to the armrests, blushing again and distracted when she kisses his fingers before they disappear into the heavy tape mitts that are then wrapped all the way around the armrest again so he can move them at all.

“What? That’s not what the ad said at all!” He protests, trying and failing to get up from the chair. “This isn’t fai-Mmmh!”</p>

            <p>Oso&#39;s rambling is cut off by the cloth shoved in his mouth, the material bulging out his cheeks and hanging out a bit.

&#34;There we go, properly silenced like a good piece of furniture.&#34; She smirks as she wraps the duct tape around his mouth, keeping the cloth trapped inside. &#34;And what a shame... your final words weren&#39;t anything special.&#34;

She grabs for the waistband of his pants, pulling it down inch by inch and revealing his boxers.

&#34;Hey, it&#39;s not all bad,&#34; she says as she slowly slides the boxers down. &#34;This is probably the first time a girl wants to see your dick.&#34;

After pulling it down, she begins wrapping up his legs in tape, leaving his feet alone for a moment as she works the tape up his legs. When she&#39;s satisfied, she uses the tape to bind his toes and feet together, eager to see his further struggles.

&#34;By the time I&#39;m done, you&#39;ll be a completely featureless, man-shaped sex toy. That&#39;s not so bad, is it? Disgusting NEETs like you probably get off on being used like this.&#34;</p>

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>If Oso’s limo cock is any indication, he doesn’t get off on the treatment. But with the highly restrictive bonds, he has no choice but to sit through the transformation. He looks at the secretary sullenly, hair hanging in his eyes from his movements. If he’s trying to get her pity it probably isn’t going to work.

He grunts when his pants and boxers are taken, leaving him only in his shirt as she tapes his legs, feet, and toes but leaves his cock to rest on the layers of tape.

Oso wiggles fruitlessly at first, soon exhausting himself with how little he can move and the fact that he can now only breath through his nose.</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>The secretary laughs as Oso wiggles and grunts in his heavy bindings, standing up with the scissors to cut his shirt off. When his chest is revealed, she gives his nipples a quick pinch before going back to the tape.

She continues by covering his stomach and torso in tape, leaving his nipples on display before moving upwards to his neck. The tape wraps around and around, layering up more of his tape gag. Only his ears, eyes, hair, and nostrils are uncovered, but things certainly won&#39;t stay that way for the former three.

&#34;Take a good look, Osomatsu,&#34; she chuckles. &#34;This is the last thing you&#39;ll ever see with those helpless eyes. No amount of struggling or crying will change that. But feel free to gaze at me before your sight is cut off forever.&#34;</p>

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Oso grunts in pain and frustration. There wasn’t any way out of this, he was completely trapped and at the secretary’s mercy! A small part of him hoped that someone might come in and be shocked at what was happening, but given her earlier speech about the true nature of the facility he doubted such a thing would happen. What did they even do with the furniture they produced? He hadn’t seen any off furniture in the front office and the chair he was starting to become was pretty obviously a person taped and confined to a regular office chair. 

The NEET sits through the rest of the taping in silence, having no other option but to accept his fate. It’s ominous that only his nipples and cock have been left free. But he won’t have the ability to see anything that happens next very soon.</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>With a kiss to his taped mouth, the secretary blindfolds Oso. With only his sense of hearing left, she takes the opportunity to give Oso&#39;s earlobe a long, sensual lick before whispering in his ear.

&#34;Such a good little toy, all bound up and helpless. When I&#39;m done with you, you&#39;ll be sold off to be someone&#39;s new chair. You&#39;ll never see, hear, or talk ever again. You just exist to be entertainment for your new owner.&#34;

She bites his earlobe, leaving for a minute to retrieve a latex mask and earplugs.

&#34;These are my final words to you. Have fun being an immobile, helpless object for the rest of your pathetic life.&#34;

She puts the earplugs in, soon applying the latex mask.</p>

            <p>Oso jolts, as much as he can jolt anyways after being reduced to little more than an office chair, when he feels her tongue on his ear. He severely regrets coming to the facility despite his excitement earlier in the day. Now he could only hope that his brothers wouldn’t find the flyer. 

What she’s saying is extremely terrifying to hear. Worse than any scary movie that he’s ever seen. He won’t be able to call for help or even see who ever decides to buy him. 

He tries to moan and plead with her to free him but the sound doesn’t quite make it out before she applies the ear plugs. Or maybe it does and he’s just unable to hear his desperate pleas for help. 

Oso barely even registers when the latex mask is put on over the tape and blindfold, blissfully unaware of his surroundings despite knowing that he’s still in the same small room.</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>The secretary grows wet at Oso&#39;s predicament, ecstatic to hear his pitiful muffled moans. He&#39;s completely helpless and isolated now, unable to do anything but whimper pathetically as he&#39;s toyed with.

She gives him one final touch: bullet vibrators attached to his nipples and set on a low setting.

Satisfied with everything, she moves Oso&#39;s chair out onto a display stage, slapping a sign on him with his price and new purpose: a 5000 yen chair, waiting to be abused and broken.

It takes an hour for him to be bought, packaged into a large box to transport him safely. Several hours pass before his new owner reaches his home, finally able to unpack and play with his new toy.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Oso has no idea what’s been attached to his nipples, only that they slightly pinch them before they start to vibrate. It’s not unbearable but after a while it starts to get hard for him to ignore. And if it weren’t for his inability to move he would likely be buckled over at the waist to try and hide the slight erection he starts to get after thirty minutes.

But it’s not enough to make him cum. He’s dripping by the time that he’s bought and boxed up to be sent to his new owner’s home. Oso feels like he’s going insane. He has no idea how much time has passed or where he is and the low vibrations aren’t helping.

He’s completely oblivious when he’s unpacked by his new owner.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>Oso&#39;s new owner takes his time to admire his new toy, eager to begin playing with him. He starts by turning up the vibrations on his nipples to the highest setting, giving his featureless face a few pats to the cheek before plugging his nose shut.

He strokes Oso off while he deprives him of air, ready to break him like the sign was asking him to. After several seconds of deprivation, he pulls away, starting to focus on the next part of the training.

He lubricates Oso&#39;s cock, stroking it to erection before he slips off his pants and underwear. He spreads himself out before riding him, faced away from Oso while he moves up and down to a steady rhythm.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>The change in vibrations is enough to clue Oso in to the fact that something has changed. Though he doesn’t know if it’s the secretary or if he’s been sold already. And he doesn’t have much time to think before he’s deprived of his air and the mysterious stranger starts to stroke his cock.

It gets to be too much and he ends up cumming into his lap while he isn’t able to breath, groaning with pleasure before the panic sets back in.

His nostrils flare when he’s able to breath properly again, aware of the hand on his cock before he feels the shift and his owner sits on his lap and starts to ride him.</p>

            <p>After he&#39;s satisfied with riding him, Oso&#39;s owner stops, turning around and giving him a slap to the face for cumming early. He plugs his nose again, pressing his head into the back of the office chair. He wonders how long it&#39;ll be before his new toy is mindbroken, and he probably won&#39;t know for certain considering that his face was covered completely and he was unable to move. But he knows he&#39;ll still have fun tormenting the poor NEET.

He pulls away, deciding to leave him alone for the rest of the night. Oso&#39;s master retrieves a breath controlling machine and a cum-stained pair of panties, stretching the cottony fabric over his head and letting it rest on his nose. Finally, he attaches the mask to his face, which covers his nose and deprives him of air before his master turns on the machine. It&#39;s automatically set to cut off air every five minutes, turning back on only when the recipient was on the very edge of passing out.

He adds a pair of weighted clamps to Oso&#39;s nipples before leaving him alone, deciding he&#39;ll leave him like this for the rest of the night and most of the next day.</p>

            <p>Oso lets out a muffled groan when he’s slapped, one that he’s unable to hear with the earplugs in. His new owner was a real sadist, depriving him of air. Oso hates it. His chest heaves as he tries and fails to breath, form going slack in the chair - as much as he’s able to anyway.

He wants to wrinkle his nose when he gets a whiff of the panties that the man stretches over his head, taking in the strong scent with no other choices available. Again, he squirms when he feels something go on after that, unsure what could possibly be next. He knows that he can’t breath again until he hears a whir of machinery that allows him to take in more of the smell of the panties. His nipples are already hard from the vibrator’s torment, making the addition of the clamps extremely painful.

The chair lets out a series of quiet whimpers, trying to figure out exactly what’s been done to him. He can’t focus once the machine gets to work cutting off his air supply. The process makes for interesting training. He’s only allowed to breath when he’s right on the edge of passing out and he’s still worked up from the vibrators, cock hard and leaking when his owner leaves him.

He has no way of knowing how much time passes like this, and he cums several times over the course of a few hours - conditioning himself to cum when he’s almost out of air.</p>

            <p>A whole night passes with the living chair suffering at the hands of the breathing mask, forced to inhale the panties through his nose. His master leaves him alone for several hours once the next day starts, occasionally taking pictures of him and sending them to his friends.

Days pass. Then a week. Then a month. Oso is barely given any attention as his master becomes busy with other things. All this time, Oso has been taped up and deprived of air, only taken off of the machine when his master felt like letting him sleep. With help from the facility surgery before he was shipped off, he didn&#39;t need to eat or do anything. He just existed to suffer as a piece of furniture.

Three months pass. His master occasionally gives him attention, sometimes doesn&#39;t let him cum for weeks on end. And all the while, he wonders just how broken the little chair is, all isolated and wrapped up in his own little world.</p>

            <p>The Matsuno household has been in complete disarray. When one of their own disappeared it went almost unnoticed for a week before any of the brothers mentioned that they hadn’t seen Oso back in the house. They aren’t worried at first but the more time that passes, the clearer it becomes that something must have happened to the eldest sextuplet.

They rifle through his things, trying to figure out where he’s gone and it’s Kara that discovers the flyer underneath a pile of mail that’s nearly three months old. As long as Oso’s been missing without any trace of where he’d gone to.

He sends a text to Choro, leaving an address and informing his brother that he might have found a lead while on route to the facility.

It’s a nice place, he thinks to himself.

“Excuse me. You haven’t seen my brother recently, have you? He went missing about three months ago.”</p>

            <p>The secretary nearly jumps in her seat when she sees Karamatsu. At first she thinks it&#39;s the NEET she sold off so many months ago, but when he mentions his brother things start to click into place.

&#34;Your brother?&#34; She purses her lips, tapping her pen on the desk. &#34;Oh, right! He&#39;s been given an internship as a part of a job offer. He&#39;s doing very well, we&#39;re sorry we couldn&#39;t contact his family in that time. Would you like to see where he&#39;s working in the building? He talks about you sometimes.&#34;</p>

            <p>Kara frowns a bit, trying to work through if what she said made sense. Why wouldn’t Oso come home after being given an internship? The facility was within walking distance of their home, he didn’t need to work himself to the bone.

“Sure. Do you know if he started renting an apartment or something? It seems strange that he wouldn’t come home. Everyone’s been really worried about him.”</p>

            <p>The secretary nods, formulating a story on the spot.

&#34;Oh, yes!&#34; She offers a smile as she stands up from the desk, motioning Kara to a long hallway. &#34;He&#39;s been very busy, so he&#39;s only had time to work. Rest assured that he has housing and he&#39;s receiving care.&#34;

The door she opens reveals a similar room to the one Oso was confined in, dimly lit and small enough to fit two or three people. In the room is a table with a few objects on top - a roll of tape, a dildo, a vibrator, and a full-body latex suit.

&#34;Oh, looks like your brother is on a short break,&#34; she says, a sadistic smile on her face as she grips onto Kara&#39;s arms. &#34;In the meantime, let&#39;s relax together before he comes back.&#34;</p>

            <p>“Well that doesn’t sound too bad I guess. Sort of inconsiderate of him. But that’s on him, not you,” he smiles, following her into the room. She seemed nice enough. Definitely too nice to be interested in Oso or even give him the time of day. 

The facility might have been useful to Kara to get a job like his older brother but he saw much more interest in trying to ask her out on a date.

“His loss.” Kara commented dryly, glancing at the secretary and grinning. “Guess it’s just the two of us, huh? I’d like it if we did a little more than...relax.”</p>
