            <p>(( I like the idea of a Matsu being put in a NEET Correctional Facility, except it&#39;s a scam that forces them into heavy bondage and permanent isolation</p>

            <p>Ooh I like it. What if it’s like a furniture factory so they all get put into that sort of bondage and we follow them from being put in it, to the show floor as a display set, and then to being sold and short period of time in their new house?</p>

            <p>(( sounds like fun! would they be placed inside already existing furniture? Or are they the furniture themselves?</p>

            <p>I feel like it’s a mix depending on what kind of furniture? Like a lamp would probably just be the Matsu while a couch would probably be a Matsu and couch together.</p>

            <p>(( makes sense! Maybe the couch seats have their ring-gagged faces poking out so their owners can sit on them.</p>

            <p>One cushion could be the mouth and the other could be his dick with a cock ring on so he could be ridden without needing the hassle of clean up. And it could be a fold out couch so if it becomes a bed there’s a Matsu just sprawled out to be your pillow and toy for the night.</p>

            <p>Before we start we should probably figure out the furniture and the set ups.</p>

            <p>(( sure! I was thinking a Matsu hammock would be nice, just hanging around outside to be lied on. Maybe even one could be trapped in a bed mattress? A footrest could work as well. Then we have the couch and lamp.

For the lamp, I think a latex mummified Matsu on a stand would work, with a dildo shoved in his mouth acting as a switch to turn the light on and off. Maybe when the dildo is being sucked on, it knows to turn the light on.</p>

        <li id="message_55397497" class="message_ooc" style="color: #000000;">
            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Oh yeah! I’m on board with the dildo and the shade and light could just be on his head. But what if the switch was a chain piercing on his nipple and it would turn the light on and get the dildo going as well as a vibrator in his ass. Then there could be tubing connecting his cock to the dildo so when he comes he also feeds himself. If he was on his knees it could even be like a nightstand lamp where his chest and head are coming through the table and the rest of him is underneath. His hands could either be trapped under or they’re flat on the table and cupped to hold things.</p>

            <span class="symbol">🌀</span>
            <p>(( oh, I love the idea of the nipple chain and the feeding! And yeah, we could make him a nightstand lamp so his owner can enjoy his suffering while they&#39;re lying in bed</p>

            <span class="symbol">●</span>
            <p>Maybe the bed is like a futon and that explains our fold out couch Matsu? And I feel like he’s in latex attached to the frame so he can’t move but then there’s a soft outer layer for the new owner’s comfort. He could also have some weight gain so he’s nice and soft.</p>

            <p>(( sweet! I also had the hammock bondage idea, along with a heavily bound and isolated footrest. Maybe a Matsu could be wrapped to a chair and act as a chair himself?</p>

            <p>So that’s...five

What if the last one was a door and the Matsu was contorted to where only his head was inside and he had something where his moans are louder so when someone is at the door and they play with him the homeowner knows someone’s at the door</p>

            <p>Hmm...probably with the pick up and getting the Matsus set up. We could do it one at a time to really focus and they could go to separate houses so we work through their little short stories and once we get through all six we move on to the next permanent idea</p>
