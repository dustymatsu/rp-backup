She had to pull her hair into a ponytail to look more professional but had to go and get her tongue and nipples pierced.

The rest of her uniform would be provided when she got to the agency.\r\n\r\nSo Totoko smiles brightly when she pushes open the glass doors and bounces past the front desk with the temporary ID she\u2019d been sent in the mail two days ago. She couldn\u2019t wait to take her picture for her official one!\r\n\r\n\u201cReporting for duty,\u201d she announces cheerfully to the idol\u2019s manager who she was told to meet beforehand to get her uniform situated."}, {"symbol": 0, "symbol_character": "\u25cf", "handle": "\u25cf", "colour": "FF6FF2", "show_edited": false, "id": 55752419, "type": "ooc", "edited": "2019-04-17T05:26:29.743690", "format": "raw", "posted": "2019-04-17T05:26:29.743690", "text": "Oh hey!
