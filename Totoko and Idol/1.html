            <p>Hella! Off topic but do you ever think about what would happen if someone else connected to one the the ones where we don’t put what the rp is actually about?</p>

            <p>(( So I was thinking for this RP that the idol Totoko is assigned to is a sadistic brat who uses Totoko as an outlet for her work-related frustrations. I imagine her as a perfectionist, along with being money-hungry. Probably uses Totoko to make an extra bit of cash from time to time.</p>

            <p>Right?
Oh yeah that could work! I also had an idea for Totoko’s uniform. It could be like a super tight blouse that’s almost like latex with only her breasts coming out through two holes.</p>

            <p>(( sounds great! Sounds very nice and humiliating. Would she be restrained or gagged in any way?</p>

            <p>Hm...maybe an arm binder too so she pushes her chest out. And maybe kind of like a bitchsuit for the bottom half so when she needs to follow the idol she has to squirm and wiggle on the floor?</p>

            <p>Yeah. So like our typical bitchsuits but it ends up turning into the latex blouse with holes and arm binder.</p>

            <p>(( Hm, maybe a clip/piercing of some sort on her tongue that connects to nipple clamps and forces her to drool? probably has to keep her head down a lot unless ordered otherwise</p>

            <p>We could also have a hook in her ass that has a tie to her hair which could be put into a ponytail and that pulls her head back some so she’s torn between the two.</p>

            <p>This was it! Her chance to get her foot in the door of some of the top idol agencies in the country! Totoko was estatic - had been since her application had been taken into consideration for a position as a personal assistant. Her own dreams to become an idol were still simmering underneath her skin but this was a step towards working in the industry. If she couldn’t be an idol, working with one was the next best thing. And she’d just gotten the call two weeks ago that she was perfect for the job!

The requirements were a little strange, but she took them in stride. She had to pull her hair into a ponytail to look more professional but had to go and get her tongue and nipples pierced. Apparently every personal assistant this idol had in the past had the piercings. And she could always take them out later if she got another job somewhere else. The rest of her uniform would be provided when she got to the agency.

So Totoko smiles brightly when she pushes open the glass doors and bounces past the front desk with the temporary ID she’d been sent in the mail two days ago. She couldn’t wait to take her picture for her official one!

“Reporting for duty,” she announces cheerfully to the idol’s manager who she was told to meet beforehand to get her uniform situated.</p>

            <p>With an idol&#39;s job being as stressful as it is, Naomi Nakano was always looking for some relief. Her many past assistants were carefully selected based on their looks and how fun it would be to humiliate them. Totoko was cute as a button and acted sweet, so the choice was obvious.

Her manager offers Totoko a smile, a bag strapped to his back containing the items needed for her uniform. The two are currently alone.

&#34;Hello, Ms. Yowai,&#34; he greets. &#34;I&#39;m glad you could make it. Naomi is very excited to meet you, but she&#39;s a little busy right now.&#34;

The manager steps out from behind the desk, motioning Totoko to follow him.

&#34;This outfit is a little hard to get into by yourself, so I&#39;ll be helping you out. If you&#39;ll follow me this way, I&#39;ll get you ready to get your picture taken.&#34;</p>
