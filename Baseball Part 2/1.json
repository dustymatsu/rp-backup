Ball gags, ring gags, tape gags, panty gags, cloth gags... the list goes on. I'm willing to play as OCs forcibly gagging a Matsu or a Matsu forcibly gagging his brother. I'm willing to play as the dom or sub!\r\n\r\nI'd especially like for many different types of gags to be used to humiliate him. Bonus points if the Matsu is really noisy and drooling while he's gagged <3\r\n\r\nSome potential scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. Oso/Choro: Oso gets fed up with Choro acting all high and mighty, so he ties him up, gags him, and humiliates him.\r\n \r\n2. Any/Akumatsu - Akumatsu materializes in a new body and has his way with one of his \"brothers\"\r\n \r\n3. Kara/Anyone: Kara gets tied up and left alone as a prank, when someone finds him and has his way with him.\r\n \r\n4. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and put into a petplay slave training program\r\n \r\n5. Totty/OCs: Todomatsu gets invited to a mixer by a cute girl, but soon discovers it's a trap when he's trussed up, gagged, and taken to a strange place.\r\n\r\n6. Jyushi/OCs: Jyushi signs up for baseball team tryouts, but the team makes him into their unwilling pet instead.\r\n\r\n7. Oso/OCs: Oso owes some guy money. After avoiding it for too long, he gets kidnapped and kept as the man's sex toy.\r\n\r\n8. Any/Any/OC: Two or more Matsus get kidnapped and forced to pleasure their new master and each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough I adore heavy bondage kinks, they're not required!
