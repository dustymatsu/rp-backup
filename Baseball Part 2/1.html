I really wanna do some Matsu noncon, specifically with gags! Ball gags, ring gags, tape gags, panty gags, cloth gags... the list goes on. I&#39;m willing to play as OCs forcibly gagging a Matsu or a Matsu forcibly gagging his brother. I&#39;m willing to play as the dom or sub!

I&#39;d especially like for many different types of gags to be used to humiliate him. Bonus points if the Matsu is really noisy and drooling while he&#39;s gagged &lt;3

Some potential scenarios:

1. Oso/Choro: Oso gets fed up with Choro acting all high and mighty, so he ties him up, gags him, and humiliates him.
 
2. Any/Akumatsu - Akumatsu materializes in a new body and has his way with one of his &#34;brothers&#34;
 
3. Kara/Anyone: Kara gets tied up and left alone as a prank, when someone finds him and has his way with him.
 
4. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and put into a petplay slave training program
 
5. Totty/OCs: Todomatsu gets invited to a mixer by a cute girl, but soon discovers it&#39;s a trap when he&#39;s trussed up, gagged, and taken to a strange place.

6. Jyushi/OCs: Jyushi signs up for baseball team tryouts, but the team makes him into their unwilling pet instead.

7. Oso/OCs: Oso owes some guy money. After avoiding it for too long, he gets kidnapped and kept as the man&#39;s sex toy.

8. Any/Any/OC: Two or more Matsus get kidnapped and forced to pleasure their new master and each other.

Although I adore heavy bondage kinks, they&#39;re not required! Just let me know if you&#39;d rather not include that sort of thing.</p>

            <p>Being the captain of the baseball team, Takeru had seen his share of unique players, all students from his college. So when a new face showed up to try out, he was skeptical, yet intrigued.

The man didn&#39;t particularly stand out, save for the big grin on his face and energetic demeanor. But he seemed to love baseball to an absurd degree. Takeru didn&#39;t bother telling him that their team was full at the moment and he wasn&#39;t looking for any new players. But the team could use a new toy.

His team had suffered many defeats recently, so everyone was restless and angry. Perhaps a pet could motivate them to win and practice harder, so he didn&#39;t turn him away. In fact, he didn&#39;t even let him test his skills.

&#34;So... Matsuno-san, was it? I can tell your love of baseball will bring you very far on our team.&#34; He offers him a smile before motioning with his head towards the equipment room. &#34;Come this way. I have something I want to show you.&#34;</p>

            <p>Jyushi is more than a little excited about his chances when Takeru addresses him directly and asks him to follow him to the equipment shed. He’d been at the field since try outs started and the captain hadn’t asked anyone else to come to the equipment shed. That could only mean good things in his mind. 

Granted, the young man was more than a little naive and quick to jump to conclusions when it came to his passion. This was all he’d ever wanted since he’d seen the team in action last spring.

“I really wanted to thank you for the opportunity Takeru-san, I promise not to let you or the team down this season,” he rambles excitedly, bouncing on his heels as he follows the other.</p>

            <p>Once Jyushi returns with the baseball, a team member takes it out of his mouth, ruffling his hair afterwards.

&#34;That&#39;s a good puppy,&#34; he praises, before handing the ball to another member. &#34;We&#39;ll have to cut you a little slack in our training session once the game&#39;s over. Go hobble on back, now.&#34;

The game is about to continue, but the team is stopped in their tracks by a faculty member.

&#34;What on Earth are you doing in that getup?&#34; He asks Jyushi, the rest of the team swearing under their breaths as they&#39;ve been caught.</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <p>For once, Jyushi is utterly speechless without the need for a gag. This could be his chance to be freed from the latex and distance himself from the baseball team. However he’s caught between the need to explain his predicament and the utter humiliation of having been found this way. At least it was a faculty member and not another student.

“I...I...” he stammers helplessly, shivering in fear as he looks up to the Professor. He shouldn’t be this nervous, he’s the victim here. “They put me in here.”</p>
          <div class="timestamp">

            <p>The Professor doesn&#39;t say anything as he looks him over, surprisingly calm given the situation. The team members hold their breath as they wait for a response, expecting to be suspended or even expelled.

The Professor motions Takeru over, the captain taking a few steps towards him.

&#34;Was this your idea?&#34; He asks, to which Takeru nods.

&#34;With all due respect, sir,&#34; he begins. &#34;The baseball team has been suffering a lot of troubles lately, and having a pet around has lifted our spirits and is helping us play better.&#34;

The Professor nods, listening intently. When he&#39;s finished explaining, he says something that shocks the whole team.

&#34;Well, it&#39;s fine, then. The baseball team is this school&#39;s pride and joy after all. If your pet is really helping you, then it&#39;s not an issue. I&#39;ll talk with Matsuno&#39;s teachers and we&#39;ll remove him from his classes.&#34;

With that, he leaves, Takeru smirking down at Jyushi.</p>
