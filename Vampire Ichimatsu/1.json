What he wanted wasn't a partner, but someone to be his slave. And what better candidate than an immortal vampire?\r\n\r\nThe Matsunov family of vampires were notorious for their deeds, but despite this Ryo had never considered killing them. Truthfully, he found the fourth son, Ichimatsu, the most desirable. So when it came time to choose his victim, Ryo knew who he'd go after.\r\n\r\nIchimatsu didn't go down without a fight. The vampire was strong, but not strong enough to evade Ryo's agility and quick wits. With some difficulty, Ryo had successfully tied up and contained Ichimatsu in a black coffin, chaining it shut before taking it home by carriage.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his mansion, Ryo carried the coffin up to his door with help from his guards.
