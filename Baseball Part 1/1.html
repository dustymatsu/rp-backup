I really wanna do some Matsu noncon, specifically with gags! Ball gags, ring gags, tape gags, panty gags, cloth gags... the list goes on. I&#39;m willing to play as OCs forcibly gagging a Matsu or a Matsu forcibly gagging his brother. I&#39;m willing to play as the dom or sub!

I&#39;d especially like for many different types of gags to be used to humiliate him. Bonus points if the Matsu is really noisy and drooling while he&#39;s gagged &lt;3

Some potential scenarios:

1. Oso/Choro: Oso gets fed up with Choro acting all high and mighty, so he ties him up, gags him, and humiliates him.
 
2. Any/Akumatsu - Akumatsu materializes in a new body and has his way with one of his &#34;brothers&#34;
 
3. Kara/Anyone: Kara gets tied up and left alone as a prank, when someone finds him and has his way with him.
 
4. Any/OCs: One or more Matsus get kidnapped and put into a petplay slave training program
 
5. Totty/OCs: Todomatsu gets invited to a mixer by a cute girl, but soon discovers it&#39;s a trap when he&#39;s trussed up, gagged, and taken to a strange place.

6. Jyushi/OCs: Jyushi signs up for baseball team tryouts, but the team makes him into their unwilling pet instead.

7. Oso/OCs: Oso owes some guy money. After avoiding it for too long, he gets kidnapped and kept as the man&#39;s sex toy.

8. Any/Any/OC: Two or more Matsus get kidnapped and forced to pleasure their new master and each other.

Although I adore heavy bondage kinks, they&#39;re not required! Just let me know if you&#39;d rather not include that sort of thing.</p>

            <p>Yes, hello, I think I’m in love with the Jyushi prompt if you’re still open to role playing with someone. Mostly because baseball is one of my all time favorite sports and the idea of the team having a gagged pet is completely phenomenal.</p>

            <p>Well I’m definitely with you in the camp of heavy bondage and aside from that I have: nipple clamps, public use, forced exercise (like a treadmill or something), slave training. And there’s definitely more that I can’t think of</p>

            <p>Hm...well I thought a college level team would be nice because of all the away games and whatnot, plus more funds. But I was thinking away games actually would be really fun because of the bus and being passed from room to room in the hotel.</p>

            <p>Being the captain of the baseball team, Takeru had seen his share of unique players, all students from his college. So when a new face showed up to try out, he was skeptical, yet intrigued.

The man didn&#39;t particularly stand out, save for the big grin on his face and energetic demeanor. But he seemed to love baseball to an absurd degree. Takeru didn&#39;t bother telling him that their team was full at the moment and he wasn&#39;t looking for any new players. But the team could use a new toy.

His team had suffered many defeats recently, so everyone was restless and angry. Perhaps a pet could motivate them to win and practice harder, so he didn&#39;t turn him away. In fact, he didn&#39;t even let him test his skills.

&#34;So... Matsuno-san, was it? I can tell your love of baseball will bring you very far on our team.&#34; He offers him a smile before motioning with his head towards the equipment room. &#34;Come this way. I have something I want to show you.&#34;</p>

            <p>Baseball had been a large part of Jyushi’s life from a young age - introduced to the sport through a little league team. And while his abilities on the field were average it had been a crucial factor in expending the practically limitless stores of energy he seemed to have. But aside from those first years he hadn’t been able to make any of the teams he tried out for and he’d had to settle for watching from the sidelines.

Which is exactly why he’d decided to find the team in the first week of the semester before the season officially began with the determination that he’d be able to hone his skills and land himself a position on the team despite his beginner status.

Takeru is friendly enough in Jyushi’s quick assessment of the Captain between explaining his love of the game and lack of experience paired with an eagerness to learn. And it’s hastily decided that his assessment was right on the nose when the man gestures towards the equipment room. 

“Y-yeah, but you can call me Jyushi.” A little quick to end formalities, but the brother is practically vibrating with excitement as he follows Takeru. “Am I really a part of the team? Well, I guess you wouldn’t say anything about being going far in the team if I wasn’t. Sorry, I’m just really excited! What’s in the equipment room? Uniforms? Do I get one now or later or is this just a fitting?”

Undoubtedly Jyushi’s talking a mile a minute, smile never leaving his face.</p>

            <p>Hey sorry for not specifiying before but I just had the idea that pre-season with actual games would be the perfect time for the team to train their new pet so he’s broken in by the time spring and summer starts</p>

            <p>Oh yeah! 

I think this would definitely be something the college knows about but it’s just kind of accepted as something the team does so Jyushi is withdrawn from his classes and whatnot. Makes appearances at pep rallies later on and is just known campus wide as the baseball team’s pet</p>

            <p>(( I like that idea a lot! Poor Jyushi would be humiliated at the pep rallies, crawling around on all fours in front of the whole campus. he could be treated like the team&#39;s cute little mascot. fans can pay to take pictures with him or even toy with him</p>

            <p>Ohh how do you feel about orgasm denial? The team doesn’t want their new pup to get too much enjoyment from his new position so maybe they outfit him with a cockring with some electric stimulation or the suit is capable of turning his cock into a useless lump so he’s “fixed”</p>

            <p>Yup! I was thinking too about maybe one of the buses for the away games being pretty adamant about a no pet policy so the team puts him in an animal crate with the luggage and they all have a remote to a dildo they’ve put in his ass - possibly two if one’s acting as a gag</p>
